Version 1.* - Written sometime in the late 80's and early 90's, I'm not
reallysure. It was Turbo Pascal and worked great until large hard drives caused
it tofail on overflows. Also, more modern OS's didn't like that it was a DOS
16-bitEXE anymore, and I didn't like that it only displayed 8.3 filenames.

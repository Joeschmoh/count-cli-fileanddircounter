Prerequisites:
--------------
   *  Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express (referred to as MSVC# in this doc).
   *  Powershell 1.0 or higher (for staging script).
   *  RAR or similar archive generator (for staging script).

Build Instructions:
-------------------
There is no specific makefile or build script for Count, it builds within the
Visual Studio UI.

Steps:
   *  Open up the solution in MSVC# using the file "Count2.2.sln".
   *  Navigate to the build menu.
   *  Hit "Build" or "Rebuild All" (optionally just hit F6).
   *  Files will be found in the appropriate release folder.   

This is a typical MSVC# solution / project, it will generally default to a
debug build when you first open the solution. Use the "Configuration Manager"
under the Build menu to switch to a release build, then rebuild the project.

Staging expects a release build to have been performed. Simple editing of the
staging script will make it pull binaries from a debug release.

Staging a release is done by executing the script "StageFiles.ps1". This is a
PowerShell 1.0 script and will require it's installation.  

I used RAR to build the final ZIP archives, but any archiver could be
substituted. Also, you can simply archive the staging "bin" and "src" folders
from using your favorite archiving application.
